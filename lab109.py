print("Python has three numeric types: int, float, and complex")
#Creating a variable
myValue=1

#Use the print() function to write the value of the variable to the shell. In the context of programming, writing means to add information to the shell.
print(myValue)

#To get the data type of the variable, use the type() built-in function:
print(type(myValue))

#To combine numbers and text, use the str() built-in function, which converts an argument into a collection of letters called a string. In this instance, you are converting the int (integer) data type into the string data type:
print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))

#Exercise 3: Introducing the float data type
myValue=3.14

#To write the value of the variable to the shell, use the print() function:
print(myValue)

#Get the data type of the variable by using the type() built-in function:
print(type(myValue))

#To combine numbers and text, use the str() built-in function:
print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))

#Exercise 4: Introducing the complex data type
myValue=5j

#Write the value of the variable with the print() function:
print(myValue)

#Get the data type of the variable with the type() function:
print(type(myValue))

#To combine numbers and text, use the str() built-in function:
print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))

#Exercise 5: Introducing the bool data type
myValue=True

#Write the value of the variable to the shell by using the print() function:
print(myValue)

#Get the data type of the variable by using the type() built-in function:
print(type(myValue))

#To combine numbers and text, use the str() built-in function:
print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))
